# My-Portfolio

## Description
From scratch, I built a portfolio that will be used to store my work for potential employers using CSS and HTML. I used CSS and HTML as the primary languages for this webapge. I expect to add at least one more language to the webpage to make it more interactive for potential employers. This portfolio is a central location for me to store my best work, and showcase it. It will continue to be updated as I add more languages and web applications to my skills set.
I do not currently have enough web applications to put on this portfolio, so I will add more later on in the course. Placeholder images and links to Google's homepage were added so it could look complete.

## Usage
For now, this is a basic webapge. All of the interactions are simple. You can click on the links at the top of the page, and they will take you to the corresponding section. The images in teh projects section are linked to either a project, or Google.com. The links in the contact section will take you to an email, my LinkedIn, or my GitHub. My cell phone number is not linked.
