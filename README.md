# My-Portfolio

## Description
From scratch, built a portfolio that will be used to store my work for potential employers using CSS and HTML. I learned how to implement: flexbox, media queries, and CSS variables into webpages. This Portfolio showcases the skills I have acquired during the first two weeks of the MSU Coding BootCamp, while also creating something that I can use during my job search. This portfolio will continue to be updated as I add more languages and web applications to my skills set.
I do not currently have enough web applications to put on this portfolio, so I will add more later on in the course.

## User Story

```
AS AN employer
I WANT to view a potential employee's deployed portfolio of work samples
SO THAT I can review samples of their work and assess whether they're a good candidate for an open position
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN I need to sample a potential employee's previous work
WHEN I load their portfolio
THEN I am presented with the developer's name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them
WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation
THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section
WHEN I click on the link to the section about their work
THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications
WHEN I am presented with the developer's first application
THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others
WHEN I click on the images of the applications
THEN I am taken to that deployed application
WHEN I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices
THEN I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport
```
