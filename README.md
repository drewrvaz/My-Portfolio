# Portfolio-Module-02-Homework

From scratch, built a portfolio that will be used to store my work for potential employers using CSS and HTML. During the second week of the program, we learned about: flexbox, media queries, and CSS variables. This homeowrk challenge is an opportunity to showcase the skills acquired during this week of the program, while also creating something that I can use during my job search.
I do not currently have enough web applications to put on this portfolio, so I will add more later on in the course.
Below are the acceptance criteria that we were provided by the MSU Coding BootCamp

## Acceptance Criteria

THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section
WHEN I click on the link to the section about their work
