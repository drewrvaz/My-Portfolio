# My-Portfolio

## Description
From scratch, built a portfolio that will be used to store my work for potential employers using CSS and HTML. I learned how to implement: flexbox, media queries, and CSS variables into webpages. This Portfolio showcases the skills I have acquired during the first two weeks of the MSU Coding BootCamp, while also creating something that I can use during my job search. This portfolio will continue to be updated as I add more languages and web applications to my skills set.
I do not currently have enough web applications to put on this portfolio, so I will add more later on in the course.

## Mock-Up
The following animation shows the web application's appearance and functionality:
